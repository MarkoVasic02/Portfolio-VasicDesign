					<h3>Hi! My name is Nikola. &#128075</h3>

					<p align="justify">I’m an art director, designer, and content creator based in Texas. I love the challenge that creativity brings as I’m constantly inspired to think, create, and design in different ways that are fun, impactful, and innovative. I graduated summa cum laude with a BFA in Visual Communication.</p>

					<br>

					<p align="justify">For the moments I feel stagnant and need to relieve stress, I punch bags and pretend I’m Mike Tyson, explore new coffee shops, and enjoy creating design & art related content on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. It’s another outlet for me to express myself, document my creative journey, and bring content that I hope is helpful, inspiring, and enjoyable for others.</p>

						“Dena is a wildly talented, dedicated designer with a radical ability to concept and consistently execute unique yet meaningful stylistic choices for every project she touches. I was consistently impressed by Dena's ambition for perfecting her craft as a design student, and have been fortunate to work with her professionally as a member of my branding team since her graduation.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p align="justify">
						Dena is both engaged by and positively responsive to all opportunities for feedback, and has a remarkable work ethic. In fact, her personal drive to create impactful work extended so far beyond what was required by her baccalaureate program that university faculty created a new award to acknowledge her accomplishments (which was presented alongside several other awards she handily attained)."
